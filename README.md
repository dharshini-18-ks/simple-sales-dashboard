1. ​Regional Performance Disparity:
 ​The West region is the top performer, generating the highest volume of sales (approximately $0.7M). This region significantly outperforms the South region, which is the lowest performer and contributes less than half the sales of the West.
​
2. Seasonal Sales Trends:
 ​Sales are highly seasonal, demonstrating a clear Q4 spike. The months of November and December show the highest sales figures, indicating peak holiday purchasing. Conversely, sales tend to dip in the late winter/early spring months (January-April).
​
3. Category Revenue Contribution:
​ The Technology product category is the primary revenue driver, accounting for the largest share of total sales at 36.4%. The business should focus on maintaining or improving margins within this key category.
​
4. Mid-Year Recovery:
​ After a stable period of low sales from May through August, there is a distinct sharp recovery starting in September, which sets the stage for the Q4 peak. Analyzing the marketing or promotional activities in September could help replicate this growth earlier in the year.
